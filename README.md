This code will show you have to filter a spam email from a regular email. This code determines this by the keywords I chose to pick. Unfortunately this code can not determine fraud. If someone spelled Iphone like lphone my code will not be able to determine the difference. If you were to upload a file with any of the keywords, my code will go through the file to determine if it is spam or not.
