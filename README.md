In this code you will be able to determine the difference between spam and regular emails. This is executed by my list of keywords. If 
a document or file includes one of the keywords it will be determined as spam. If the file or document does not then it will be classified as regular email.
Unfortunatly this code cannot determine fruad. If a person were to spell Iphone like lphone my code will not be able to see the difference and users may be fooled by the difference. 
We will plan on adding more features to this code later. One feature will be to import fraud detection or determine if one company continues to notify you nonstop.
